What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do
you see as most useful?
The purpose of HTML tags involve:
-Allowing code to run faster
-Allowing screen readers to know more about the content.
-Allowing search engines to properly index content
-Allowing future readers of the code to know where to pick
up from
-Easier to update pages

The most useful elements: main, nav, header, footer, section,
article, aside

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays elements from the top to the bottom of the
html page. In the case of JavaScript pasted at the end of the body
tag, a flash of unformated content (FOUC) will appear as the JS
will only be reviewed when the browser gets there.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you
think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned how I can create snippets in Sublime. Now that I know
that I can do it for other languages, I will definitely create
a lot more snippets.


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How
can you improve your understanding of this concept?
The code-snippet challenge was the most difficult for me because
it was something I hadn't encountered before. I was able to get
through it because I had looked up a reference beforehand and that
allowed me to understand what I thought was gibberish at the
beginning. I think I will look up material before the my other
GPS sessions to stay on top of things.
