  <h1> The importance of challenging yourself </h1>

  <p>There is often a lot of chatter about getting out of one's comfort zone and, more often than not, it is seen as a buzz phrase. It has become clich√©.</p>

  <p>There are some things where it may not appear cool (because no one sees you) to others but it may be important to challenge yourself.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaning up your messy apartment: No one will know unless you invite them in.</li>
    <li>Your flexibility: No one will know unless you are in a yoga class</li>
    <li>Appreciation of alone-time: No one will know that you enjoy spending time on your own. Others won't be partaking in your fun.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here's a list of things I did on my own in chronological order the past year:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Learn to ice skate outdoors</li>
    <li>Try to dance tango</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The things I did were by no means <em>easy</em> but the important thing to note is to <strong>go out there and explore.</strong></p>

  <p>Here is something for you to try out. <a href="https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/">Mindful meditation </a></p>
