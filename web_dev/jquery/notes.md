My approach to learning something new is to:
1. Check the API's/languages own documentation
    http://api.jquery.com/

2. Look through the recommended tutorials from the website itself
    http://try.jquery.com/
3. Search for cheatsheets
    https://oscarotero.com/jquery/
    https://websitesetup.org/jquery-cheat-sheet/
4. Use Codecademy to try out a few things
5. Use w3schools and tutorialpoint for small projects
    https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/
    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/
6. Search stackoverflow for issues I don't understand or even post a question

I study topics in 25 minute intervals and with a 10 minute
break and this is the approach I plan to take. This is the
best way for me not to get tired by pacing myself.
I would use cheatsheets as sometimes the documentation may
get me into a rabbit hole and if I don't have the time,
I will be able to see ahead and understand the important work.

The most effective strategy was following the recommended
tutorial on jQuery's site. It had videos that showed why
jQuery was needed and how it would be used.
