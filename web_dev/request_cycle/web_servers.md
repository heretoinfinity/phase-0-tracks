Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
It is a bad idea because root user privileges allow you to
do things without checks and give the program the ability to
do anything and both are security risks. This applies to
viruses and program bugs. One doesn't want to have a bug in
a program wipe out or affect other programs or the system
and compromise the workstation's security.
