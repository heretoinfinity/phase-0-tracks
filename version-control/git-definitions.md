# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the process of organizing changes as they happen so as to be able to return to them when needed. It is useful as one can track the development and changes in the codebase and revert to previous changes if needed.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch represents a development trajectory. You can use one when you want to try something slightly different separately. This would not affect the main workflow when your team is working on different things/features.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit represents a recorded change in your workflow. A good commit message has concise title, a body that explains what the change is but not how it is implemented as the code does that and a footnote of the issue solved, if issues are tracked.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is what occurs when Git does not incorporate changes from 2 branches that are in the same area and were not at the parent point of where the branches split.
